# FarmBug_Workshop

**IMPORTANT: For the FarmBug, we use the setup project we created earlier with the blinking LED. If you don't have this project, please complete [these steps](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023#2-farmbug-project-chip-configuration-firmware-coding-and-debugging) first.**

[Part 1 is covering the implementation of CapSense for the Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/onethinx/FarmBug_Workshop/tree/main/Part_1_Adding_Moisture_Sensor)
